This is package to do text folding like in Vim. It has the following
features:

* it works on regions you select;

* it's persistent: when you close file your folds don't disappear;

* it's obvious which parts of text are folded;

* it doesn't break anything.

## Installation

If you would like to install the package manually, download or clone it and
put on Emacs' `load-path`, then you can require it in your init file like
this:

```emacs-lisp
(require 'vimish-fold)
```
