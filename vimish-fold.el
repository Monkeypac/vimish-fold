;;; Commentary:

;; This is package to do text folding like in Vim. It has the following
;; features:
;;
;; * it works on regions you select;
;;
;; * it's persistent: when you close file your folds don't disappear;
;;
;; * it's obvious which parts of text are folded;
;;
;; * it doesn't break anything.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'f)

;; TODO write the package here

(provide 'vimish-fold)

;;; vimish-fold.el ends here
